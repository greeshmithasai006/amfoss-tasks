# TERMINAL WIZARD
First i installed git by using some simple git commands and then cloned the repository . After cloning i created a directory . Then i started doing the challenges . I found out the vlues of x and y from where i got the spellword and spell . I continued rest of all challenges in a same process and found the spellword and spell .   
i stored all my spells in finalcode.txt and later i decoded all those spells by taking help . I got a link when i decoded all my spells . 
when i opened that link I was told to run the python file in terminal and was asked to take the screenshot of output . I uploaded that screenshot and solution.md in which i wrote all the commands which i used in the whole process.
